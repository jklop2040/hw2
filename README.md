I am building a website for marketing a business. This is for my HW2 assignment, I will be adding the design/look of the website by adding Tailwind CSS framework. Specifically I'll be adjusting page elements, adding a flexbox, adding a form, and launching the website.
The business I'm choosing to build is a fake business built to encourage people to exercise.
The business is called Fifty-Gifty
